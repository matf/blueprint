# Configure the Aggregation / Composition / Container

There are two kind of Aggregates. The first is the "Composition". The second is the "Container". The Composition is a collection of things that compose a higher level thing. The Container is a collection of things that are contained in another thing but it is not composed by them.

Containers are not as strong as Compositions. Use Compositions for a start.


```turtle
bp:Aggregate a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Aggregate" ;
    rdfs:comment "An aggregate is a collection of things, such as a list of items, a set of items, or a group of items." ;
.

bp:Composition a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf bp:Aggregate ;
    rdfs:label "Composition" ;
    rdfs:comment "A composition is a collection of things, that compose a higher level thing." ;
.

bp:Container a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf bp:Aggregate ;
    rdfs:label "Container" ;
    rdfs:comment "A container is a collection of things, that are contained in a another thing but it is not composed by them." ;
.
```


## Tree
Here we configure a Namespace to be an Aggregate. We define the Boundary and the Connection Points.

First we define the internals of a Namespace. We define a Tree Structure with the following levels:

- Namespace
  - Ingress
    - Host
  - Deployment
  - StatefulSet

The Namespace is the Root of the Tree. The Ingress and Deployment are the first level of the Tree. The Host is a child of the Ingress. The Deployment and StatefulSet are children of the Namespace.

Technically we define a SHACL Shape for each level of the Tree. You can see it as a "chained" SHACL shapes.

With a configuration like this Blueprint knows a lot more about your Namespace. It has some effects in the UI. 

**Inventory**

You see it in the Inventory.

![Inventory](img/inventory.png)

And you can search it or you can have a look at the contents of the Namespace. In many cases it's more to use this and not the "Search". Because you have more context.

![Inventory](img/inventory_detail.png)

**Explore**
Blueprint shows the information about trees in the Explore View in two ways. 

![Explore](img/explore.png)

In the example are exploring the Ingress. In the blue Box you see the tree "upwards". It means this Ingress is part of a Namespace. In the green Box you see the tree "downwards". It means this Ingress has a Host. It is all based on the same Tree configuration.



# Links between Aggregates

##Â Aggregate to Node links 
Now we have defined an Aggregates. Lets say we have defined our Namespace tree as a composition. We can now look "into" the Namespace. But we can also look "at" the Namespace. That means we define links to a Namespace (as the composed one - basically a link to the namespace tree).

Here we go. We define a link between a Namespace and an OCI Image. The link is a CompositionToNodeLink. It means the Namespace is the composed one and the OCI Image is the Node.

    rdfs:label "Depends on OCI Images" ;             # a label we can show in the UI
    bp:inverseLabel "OCI Images are used by" ;       # if we see the link in the opposite direction we show this label
    # there a two links between a Namespace and an OCI Image
    # the "connection" points are the Deployment and the StatefulSet
    # here we define the path from a "connection" point to the OCI Image
    sh:property [                                   
        sh:targetClass k8s:Deployment ;             # the source of the link (connection point Deployment)
        sh:path k8s:image ;                         # the path to follow to reach the target node (the OCI Image)
        sh:class oci:Image ;                        # the target class of the instance on the other side of the link
    ];
     sh:property [
        sh:targetClass k8s:StatefulSet ;            # the source of the link (connection point StatefulSet)
        sh:path k8s:image ;                         # the path to follow to reach the target node (the OCI Image)
        sh:class oci:Image ;                        # the target class of the instance on the other side of the link
    ]
.
```

This leas to the following UI.

or this in the opposite direction
